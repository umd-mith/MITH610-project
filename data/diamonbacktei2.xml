<p>The serious shortage of physicians and<lb/>
dentists this <placeName>nation</placeName> faces is a fact ac­-<lb/>
knowledged by federal experts and public<lb/>
alike. However, one of the least known<lb/>
aspects of this problem is the appalling<lb/>
<supplied>shortage of black physicians and dentists.</supplied></p><lb/>
<p>Among white Americans, one out of<lb/>
every 670 is a physician but among black</p><lb/>
<!-- There is a picture in the middle of the paragraph -->
<p>Americans, only one in 5,000 practices<lb/>
medicine. Whereas there is one dentist<lb/>
for every 1,750 Americans there is only<lb/>
one black dentist for every 10,000 black<lb/>
Americans.</p><lb/>
<p>The crux of the problem is that there<lb/>
<cb/>
are <supplied>far too few black college students<lb/>
who enter medical and dental schools.</supplied><lb/>
There appear to be four principal rea­-<lb/>
sons that these schools are not attract­<lb/>
ing a sufficient number of qualified <persName ref="#BLK">Negro</persName><lb/>
applicants.</p><lb/>
<p>The first reason is that among Negro<lb/>
college students, many <supplied>lack the life-long<lb/>
academic preparation necessary</supplied> to<lb/>
pursue the highly demanding and com­-<lb/>
petitive pre-dental and pre-medical cur­-<lb/>
ricula.</p><lb/>
<p>Secondly, a <supplied>lack of communication</supplied> ex-<lb/>­
ists between medical and dental schools<lb/>
and black undergraduates, resulting in a<lb/>
belief among the latter that racial origin<lb/>
is a serious deterrent to a career in med­-<lb/>
icine or dentistry.</p><lb/>
<p>The third reason is that many black<lb/>
students feel the <supplied>cost</supplied> of dental or med­-<lb/>
ical education would be prohibitive.</p><lb/>
<p>The fourth is that many black students<lb/>
are unaware of the opportunities which<lb/>
would be opened to them as physicians<lb/>
and dentists.</p><lb/>
<p>We feel that <supplied>these four reasons should<lb/>
not deter any black student</supplied> on this cam­-<lb/>
pus from the attainment of worthwhile<lb/>
careers in dentistry or medicine.</p><lb/>
<p>For the black student who finds his<lb/>
background inadequate in any subject, he<lb/>
can readily obtain tutoring assistance by<lb/>
<cb/>
contacting his instructor, the study skills<lb/>
program of the <orgName>Counseling Center</orgName>; the<lb/>
freshman hoaoraries, <orgName>Phi Eta Sigma</orgName> and<lb/>
<orgName>Alpha Lambda Delta</orgName>; the honors dorms,<lb/>
<placeName>Cambridge A</placeName> and <placeName>Hagerstown 5th</placeName>; the<lb/>
Junior affiliates of the <orgName>American Chem­-<lb/>
ical Society</orgName> and other departmental hon­-<lb/>
oraries.</p><lb/>
<p>For the black student who is concerned<lb/>
about any problem he might encounter as<lb/>
a Negro applicant, the <orgName>Pre-Dental and<lb/>
Pre-Medical societies</orgName> will offer their<lb/>
assistance in obtaining pertinent and re­-<lb/>
liable information.</p><lb/>
<p>Concerning racial discrimination in<lb/>
medicine, we quote an article from<lb/>
<orgName>Ebony</orgName> magazine:</p><lb/>
<p>The various clinical colleges and<lb/>
academies, like the <orgName>American College<lb/>
of Surgeons</orgName> and the <orgName>American Col-<lb/>­
lege of Physicians</orgName> have <supplied>practically<lb/>
eliminated their racial bars so that<lb/>
Negro physicians are admitted just as<lb/>
others, as soon as properly qualified<lb/>
and sponsored.</supplied></p><lb/>
<p>Similarly, the various specialty<lb/>
boards certify Negro physicians as<lb/>
specialists without restriction when<lb/>
they have met the respective training<lb/>
requirements and passed the examin­-<lb/>
ations.</p><lb/>
<p>For the black student who needs finan-<lb/>­
cial assistance, there are numerous<lb/>
awards available from professional<lb/>
schools, medical societies, Federal and<lb/>
state governments, and various other<lb/>
sources.</p><lb/>
<p>Again quoting from <orgName>Ebony</orgName>, "Today<lb/>
there are more medical school openings<lb/>
available to Negro students than there can<lb/>
be found <supplied>qualified applicants</supplied> to fill." For<lb/>
example, <orgName>Harvard Medical School</orgName> plans<lb/>
to provide at least 15 scholarships per-<lb/>
class for disadvantaged students.</p><lb/>
<p>For the black student, a career in den­-<lb/>
tistry or medicine offers the opportunity<lb/>
for a constructive role in attaining social,<lb/>
economic, and political equality in any<lb/>
community.</p><lb/>
<p><roleName>President</roleName> <persName>Johnson</persName> proclaimed to mem­-<lb/>
bers of the <orgName> National Medical Associa­-<lb/>
tion</orgName> in a recent address that<supplied> Negro<lb/>
professional men must be their "broth­-<lb/>
ers' keepers" and "...must provide the<lb/>
leadership, the brains and courage."</supplied></p><lb/>
<!-- How is it their responsibilty for your lack of outreach? -->
<p>The <orgName>Pre-Dental and Pre-Medical so-<lb/>­
cieties</orgName> strongly urge any black students<lb/>
interested in these professions to in­-<lb/>
vestigate our programs.</p><lb/>
